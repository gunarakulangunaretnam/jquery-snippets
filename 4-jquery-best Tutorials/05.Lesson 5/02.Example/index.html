                Here's another problem on which to practice your object-oriented analysis: You have been hired by
                Acme Software, Inc., to start a new software project and to hire a team of C++ programmers to
                implement your program. Jim Grandiose, vice-president of new product development, is your new
                boss. He wants you to design and build PostMaster, a utility to read electronic mail from various
                unrelated e-mail providers. The potential customer is a businessperson who uses more than one e-mail
                product, for example Interchange, CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online, Delphi, Internet Mail,
                Lotus Notes, AppleMail, cc:Mail, and so forth.


                PostMasterProfessional, to be developed as version 2 of PostMaster, is already anticipated. It will add
                an Administrative Assistant mode, which will allow the user to designate another person to read some
                or all of the mail, to handle routine correspondence, and so forth. There is also speculation in the
                marketing department that an artificial intelligence component might add the capability for
                PostMaster to pre-sort and prioritize the mail based on subject and content keywords and associations.
                Other enhancements have been talked about, including the ability to handle not only mail but
                discussion groups such as Interchange discussions, CompuServe forums, Internet newsgroups, and so
                forth. It is obvious that Acme has great hopes for PostMaster, and you are under severe time
                constraints to bring it to market, though you seem to have a nearly unlimited budget.

                You set up your office and order your equipment, and then your first order of business is to get a good
                specification for the product. After examining the market, you decide to recommend that development
                be focused on a single platform, and you set out to decide among DOS; UNIX; the Macintosh; and
                Windows, Windows NT, and OS/2.
                You have many painful meetings with Jim Grandiose, and it becomes clear that there is no right
                choice, and so you decide to separate the front end, that is the user interface or UI, from the back end,
                the communications and database part. To get things going quickly, you decide to write for DOS first,
                followed by Win32, the Mac, and then UNIX and OS/2.
                This simple decision has enormous ramifications for your project. It quickly becomes obvious that
                you will need a class library or a series of libraries to handle memory management, the various user
                interfaces, and perhaps also the communications and database components.
                Mr. Grandiose believes strongly that projects live or die by having one person with a clear vision, so
                he asks that you do the initial architectural analysis and design before hiring any programmers. You
                set out to analyze the problem.
