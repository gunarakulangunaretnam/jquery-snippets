                    of mammal, and so forth. Taxonomists divide the world of living things into Kingdom, Phylum, Class,

                    It is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence to seek out, recognize, and create relationships
                    among concepts. We build hierarchies, matrices, networks, and other interrelationships to explain and
                    understand the ways in which things interact. C++ attempts to capture this in inheritance hierarchies.
                    Today you will learn.What is a dog? When you look at your pet, what do you see? A biologist sees a network of interacting
                    organs, a physicist sees atoms and forces at work, and a taxonomist sees a representative of the
                    species canine domesticus.It is that last assessment that interests us at the moment. A dog is a kind of canine, a canine is a kind
